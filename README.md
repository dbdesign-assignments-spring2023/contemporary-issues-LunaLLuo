#Big Data Surveillance in China during the pandemic: a good tool for COVID-19 prevention or for autocracy
In this document, I discuss two articles about Big Data surveillance in China during the pandemic period, as well as the claims made by different groups of people. One believes that the big data surveillance is used to enforce the management power of Chinese government, which is potentially harmful for the citizens, the other people suggests that the big data is beneficial since it helps to prevent the spreading of COVID-19.


## Application of Big Data Technology for COVID-19 Prevention and Control in China: Lessons and Recommendations: Article 2 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33001836/ 
This paper pointed out that in China, big data technology is being used to track and prevent the spread of COVID-19. The government and tech companies have implemented a comprehensive surveillance system that includes real-time monitoring of people's movements, health status, and personal information. 
This information is analyzed to identify potential hotspots, track the spread of the virus, and implement quarantine measures to curb its spread. This big data approach has proven effective in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases in China and has been praised by the government as a critical tool in their fight against the pandemic.

## China’s ‘surveillance creep’: how big data COVID monitoring could be used to control people post-pandemic https://theconversation.com/chinas-surveillance-creep-how-big-data-covid-monitoring-could-be-used-to-control-people-post-pandemic-164788

This article suggests that also big data surveillance helps to prevent the serenading of COVI-19 ostensibly, the major goal of its implementation is to enforce the country's autocratic rule. 
The system is also used to target ethnic and religious minorities and suppress political opposition. The use of big data in this way has raised concerns about privacy and freedom, and has been criticized by human rights organizations as a tool of repression. Despite these concerns, the government continues to expand its use of big data to maintain its grip on power.
